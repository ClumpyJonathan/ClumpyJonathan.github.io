        <h2>League of Legends Rank Visualized // 26-05-20</h2>
        This was a little project I worked on in between games of everyone's favourite MOBA - League of Legends. Just for fun, I wanted to see if it was possible to visualize the grind of the LoL ranked ladder. It turned out to be easier than I thought. <a href="https://na.op.gg" target="_blank">op.gg</a> is a website that allows you to view your match history and win rate. I imported data from op.gg into my own spreadsheets and recorded the results. They looked something like this:<br>

        In League of Legends, each rank has 100 "League Points", which you obtain from winning games. To oversimplify things, once you reach 100 LP, you rank up. I needed a way to convert League Points and Rank into a single value that I could use in order to plot it. Accomplishing this was fairly simple with what is basically a lookup table.<br>
