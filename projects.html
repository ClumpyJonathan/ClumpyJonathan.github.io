        <a href="pewgame/pew.html">Pew game</a> A simple little two-player game made in JavaScript with no external libraries. Controls: Player 1 - Arrow keys + mouse; Player 2 - WASD + Space. Made in a couple hours at MasseyHacks V for our group webpage.<br><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/ClumpyJonathan/group_0223_final">CSC207 Final Project (GitHub)</a> A group project resulting in a calendar application. The project was written in Java and I used Git for the first time. Some functionality is broken or not fully finished. Users can create new accounts, login, create multiple calendars, add events to calendars, search calendars by certain attributes, etc. I was personally responsible for the GUI programming, implementing many of the layouts found in JavaX and using external libraries to assist with, for example, selecting a date.<br><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/ClumpyJonathan/ClumpyJonathan.github.io">Webpage Source (GitHub)</a> All the code and resources used in the website you are currently viewing.<br><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/team-big-o/team-big-o.github.io">MasseyHacks V Project (GitHub)</a> A group project made for MasseyHacks V in 48 hours. The objective was to create something to keep our world's water clean. Our approach was to make a website to spread awareness about the importance of water. This was accomplished through creating games to target kids and a calculator to show how much water consumption an individual actually has.<br><br>
        <a href="Data_Management_Project_Part2.pdf" target="_blank">Grade 12 Statistics Final Project</a> The written portion of my Grade 12 Statistics course. I really think this is worth including since the content is not only very interesting to me, but demonstrates proficiency in manipulating spreadsheet data, data visualization/presentation, and LaTeX. The goal was to identify a method for correlating various factors (net migration, education spending, population, homicide rate) with GDP per capita.<br><br>
